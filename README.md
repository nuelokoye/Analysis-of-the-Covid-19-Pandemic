Analysis of the Covid-19 Pandemic using MYSQL, Figma and Tableau. 

## Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious viral illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
After the first cases of this predominantly respiratory viral illness were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly disseminated across the world in a short span of time, compelling the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare it as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. 
COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. Typically Coronaviruses present with respiratory symptoms such as Fever, Cough, Shortness of breath, Breathing difficulties, Fatigue, Sore throat, and in severe cases pneumonia. 
To prevent transmission of the virus, Vaccination was introduced.

 
## project strategy
The Covid_19 dataset was downloaded from the Our World in Data. Microsoft Excel was used in the initial cleaning and then loaded into MYSQL workbench. The dashboard was designed with Tableau and Figma.
The main steps for this project are summarized  below:

## Summary 
Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a shocking loss of life and posed an unparalleled threat to food systems, public health, and the workplace. Millions of lives were lost as a result of the pandemic. Therefore, we need to reevaluate our outlook on the environment and take urgent and ambitious action to combat climate change and environmental damage.
